        <h2>Welcome to Talk Trois</h2>
    <div class="col-md-12" style="font-size: 24px;" >
        <p>Hello and welcome to the Talk Trois log! This space serves as a record of our discussions, which take place roughly every ten days among Abu, Saahil, and Harsh. However, we warmly invite anyone interested to join us. </p>
        <p>Initially, during our vacation, we started our conversations focused on books, but our topics have since expanded to include short stories and essays. Much of our time together is spent reconnecting and enjoying casual banter—so don’t feel intimidated! In fact, Saahil often shows up without having read anything, and that’s perfectly fine! </p>
        <p>Our aim is to explore literature without the heavy constraints often imposed by conventional standards and rather do it naturally through recommendations. We try approach it as a journey of discovery, unearthing hidden gems from various cultures—be it stories in our native languages or science fiction from Southeast Asia. Honestly, even we aren’t quite sure where this exploration will lead us, but we encourage you to both observe and participate.</p>
        <p>Below, you’ll find sections detailing the topics we’ve covered so far.<br>
        <i>P.S. Talk Trois (pronounced “twah”) is a playful nod to the well-known podcast <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33319832/">Talk Tuah</a>, where “trois” means “through” in French. Yes, we really do talk through!</i></p>

        <h2>#1: Birth of Tragedy by Nietzsche</h2>
        <p>We kicked off our journey with Nietzsche&rsquo;s seminal work, delving into his insights on art, culture, and the human experience. This exploration of tragedy laid the groundwork for our future discussions. While we appreciated the first third of the book, the second third was met with some resistance, and the final third managed to provide a satisfactory conclusion. Interestingly, Nietzsche&rsquo;s own critiques of his work were particularly effective in conveying his ideas. Book with annotations can be found <a href="https://github.com/ceyxasm/Archive/blob/main/books/birth-of-a-tragedy.pdf">here</a>.</p>
