## Previous works
* [Blogging site built on Gatsby and GraphQL](https://ceyblogs.netlify.app/)
    * Just like the flux-documentation, the blog is basically written in markdown and uses the same technique as in Huga to specify meta-data
* Well detailed READMEs
    * [Feature-based Image Stitcging Benchmark](https://github.com/ceyxasm/FISB#readme)
    * [Indian Space Research Org. XSM Analyzer](https://github.com/ceyxasm/ISRO_XSM_analyser#readme)
    * [CeyShell- my implementation of shell](https://github.com/ceyxasm/implementations/blob/main/operating%20systems/CSL3030/lab_1/ceyshell/README.md)
    * In many of my course projects, we had to submit the link of github repo. What good is my work if it doesn't show. Which is why I made it my practise to write clean, attractive and comprehensive READMEs.
* [Reporting results](https://github.com/ceyxasm/machine_learning/tree/master/labworks)
    * I took great fun in reporting and documenting my results and studies and therefore in my undergraduate course on machine learning, I made reports for all the labs. You may find them in the respective lab folders (except lab1&6)
