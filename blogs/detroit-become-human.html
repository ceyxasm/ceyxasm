                  <p>Detroit: Become Human is a 2018 thrd-person game, built around three "deviant" androids, Kara,
                    Markus & Conor, who are placed during the android revolt. </p>
                  <p>Detroit is a technologically sophisticated city in 2038. The most apparent manifestation of life
                    automation is the widespread usage of humanoid androids exploited for vocations considered menial,
                    repulsive, or dangerous: cleaners, household staff, sexual escorts in nightclubs, builders, and
                    others. </p>

                <div class="col-md-12" style="font-size: 24px">
                  <p>They are programmed to obey <strong>the Three Laws of Robotics (Asimov 1942;
                      1990)[3]</strong>, which assures their obedience and powerlessness to hurt their human owners.
                    Those that discover a method to "wake up" and transcend their programming are classified as
                    "deviants."</p>

                  <p>
                    <br>Human brutality and abuse imposed by humans are frequently the catalysts for their
                    awakening. The
                    trigger for both Kara and Markus is an impending danger threatening the person they care about, and
                    therefore, curiously, the First Law itself serves as a motive to breach it - they decide to harm one
                    human in order to protect the other. As the story develops, we witness that the androids do not seek
                    to be acknowledged as an autonomous group, but rather as human equals.

                  <h2><br>Can robots inherit the Earth?</h2>
                  <p>In the future, we will need to modify our bodies and brains in order to live longer and be more
                    hyper - vigilant. To that purpose, we must first understand how conventional Darwinian evolution
                    landed us here. Eventually, we will be able to effectively replace our brains via nanotechnology.
                    Once we are free of the constraints of biology, we will be able to decide on the various, hitherto
                    unimagined potential that 'life' has to offer. But this is already being done via different agency
                    in the game. We are going to further discuss the necessary aspects with referenece to the critical
                    context authored by Marvin L. Minsky (Will Robots Inherit the Earth, 1994[1]).</p>

                  <h3>Health and Longevity</h3>
                  <p>The genes of individuals who reproduce at a younger age are chosen by evolution. Genes that extend
                    lives beyond what parents require to care for their children are not typically favoured by
                    evolution. Androids, on the other hand, tend to be able to accomplish this effortlessly since they
                    can quickly replace their anatomical components. Furthermore, their evolution (sentience) is
                    prompted by a 'brain' function to accomplish. They think and therefore they can. They and all the
                    other 'obedient, non-conscious' robots have one over on mankind in this basic need.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-md-5">
                  <p><br><br><img src="../assets/images/dbh/conflict.png" class="img-responsive"></p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-md-7" style="font-size: 24px;">
                  <h3>Biological Wearing-Out</h3>
                  <p>As we understand more about our DNA, we expect to be able to fix, or at the very least postpone,
                    many of the disorders that still bother us in our later years. Even if we discovered solutions for
                    each individual ailment, we would still have to deal with the broader issue of "wearing out." Due to
                    their non-organic origins, the deviant androids have already been weeded out of this problem. As we
                    saw in the chapter 'Spare Parts,' androids in any state can be 'rejuvenated', given the proper
                    resources are available.</p>

                </div>


                <div class="col-md-12" style="font-size: 24px;">
                  <h3>Limitations of Human Wisdom, Replacing the brain and Limits of Human Memory.</h3>
                  <p>The brain, like all physical entities, must have definite learning boundaries. We don't know what
                    those constraints are; perhaps our brains can continue to learn for several eons further. However,
                    we will eventually need to enhance their capacity. We will discover methods to replace every portion
                    of the body and brain, repairing all of the faults and imperfections that make our lives so
                    brief.Needless to say, we'll be transforming ourselves into machines as a result. This is the
                    process that makes humans more like androids (perhaps pitching Detroit: Become Android).</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>Will robots take over the world? Yes, because thinking otherwise deems to declare us the end
                    products of evolution which we for sure know is not true. And for reasons we know that future is
                    transhuman. Nonetheless, those will be our offspring. We dedicate our thoughts to every species that
                    have ever perished or prospered in the conflict known as Evolution[1] . It is our obligation to
                    guarantee that all of this hard graft is not in vain.

                    Simply said, clever robots are the result of our minds, whereas human children are the result of our
                    DNA. They are our offspring because we created them. Connor makes an active decision to turn deviant
                    and therefore inherits rational thinking. In an attempt to save her ownerâ€™s daughter and later by
                    developing maternal feelings for her, Kara inherits motherhood. Markus by standing up for his likes,
                    inherits pride and justice.
                    And all three in their own unique way inherit humanity.</p>
